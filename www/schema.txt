Base Game Scenario

	The user is asked to complete missions that require him to move his
	character accross various interconnected locations, fetching and
	delivering items, gathering clues, reaching checkpoints, etc.

	As the user progress in his missions, the range of locations he can
	travel expands location by location.

	The user move from one location to another by tracing paths with his fingers
	or mouse from point A to B to C to D, etc. At each steps, the route
	spends accumulated time until the user reach "current time" and he then has
	to wait for the trajectory to complete in real-time, or until more time is
	accumulated.

	The time needed for a route depends on the relative scale of each game board
	on which the user traces hi path and how direct or sinous the paths are. Some
	boards might includes constraints or incentives to make it challenging for the
	user to make a direct and economic route.

	For example, tracing through 12 local boards in a mall might require 20 minutes,
	while tracing through 5 screen to travel from NYC to Texas will take 9 hours.

	The speed at which a user does the tracing could also be taken in account when
	calculating the cost of the route: Faster tracing could earn the user a cheaper
	route, thus rewarding agility and memory skills aquired through practice.

	As a user learns through geographic memory and muscle memory, he can trace
	complete routes faster and faster, requiring the UI to be instanteneous.

	Also, the user could gain items and power-ups to further optimize the time he
	his granted every day.

Time Management

	Time is one of the main game currency and constraint in the game. Time allowance
	is based on the real-life 24h clock, with a certain ammount which the user can
	accumulate between game sessions.

General Requirements
	- Navigation between boards must be:
		- Next to instanteneous.
		- Touch friendly
		- Fluid
		- Game-like


Notes:
	- Maps and Places inherit from Board (As in game-board)
	- While boards might feel hierarchical, they are not. They are simly linked.
	- When diplaying the UI, each POI type will have a distinct icon
	- Scenes should be HD with safe-area rules for scaling down to 1024x768 and for mark placements
	- border exits are communicated visually with a jagged screen edge or a similare effect
	- Boards are inspired by real-life locations, but they are not true real places with coordinates to be mapped on planet earth,
	- Some board sets can be inspired by imaginary and/or invented places (hell, paradise, 6th dimension, john malchovich head, ant hole, never-never land)


Marks
	- id
	- x, y, z
	- type (destination, character, object)
	- isDefault
	- isDefaultIfFromBoard
	- goToBoard (for exit/destination marks)
	- destinationType (airport, building, house, park, etc...)

Rules for Board Background Image
	- Resolution (full HD)
	- Safe area for flexible image ratios (croping and edge carving for border exits)
	- Safe area for placing marks
	- Safe area for fade-in/out UI elements (menus, status, stats, etc)



IDEAS POSPONED LATER
	- Object marks
	- Character marks (with specific poses)
	- Multiple layers for overlapping scene elements
	- Unlocking POIs (with options for secret POIs, imageOn, imageOff, invisibleIfNotFound)
	- Boards with multiple states depending on factors (time, game state, sensors)
